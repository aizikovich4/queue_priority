# queue_priority
Queue with priorities  (test task)
my testing task for Sperasoft
Task 1: Need to design and implement a priority queue in C, and provide a test application which demonstrates that the queue is working.
A few requirements:
1. Priority values are integers
2. Priority queues should be thread-safe
3. Priority queues should generate "High water mark"/"Low water mark" events.
4. Test application should create at least two threads writing into the queue and at least two threads reading from the queue.
5. For anything which isn't mentioned in these requirements, you can make a choice yourself.
6. Test application should come with some instructions for compiling it.
